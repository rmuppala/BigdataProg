101|Introduction to Data Science in Python|This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The course will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses|University of Michigan|Christopher Brooks|Course 1 of 5 in the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization |Intermediate|English, Subtitles: Chinese (Traditional), Portuguese (Brazilian), Vietnamese, Korean|Pass all graded assignments to complete the course.|4.5
102|What is Data Science?|The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been around since ancient times. The ancient Egyptians used census data to increase efficiency in tax collection and they accurately predicted the flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then, people working in data science have carved out a unique and distinct field for the work they do. This field is data science. In this course, we will meet some data science practitioners and we will get an overview of what data science is today.|IBM| Alex Aklson, Ph.D., Data Scientist|Course 1 of 9 in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Specialization|Beginner|English|Pass all graded assignments to complete the course.|4.6
103|SQL for Data Science|As data collection has increased exponentially, so has the need for people skilled at using and interacting with data; to be able to think critically, and provide insights to make better decisions and optimize their businesses. This is a data scientist, “part mathematician, part computer scientist, and part trend spotter” (SAS Institute, Inc.). According to Glassdoor, being a data scientist is the best job in America; with a median base salary of $110,000 and thousands of job openings at a time. The skills necessary to be a good data scientist include being able to retrieve and work with data, and to do that you need to be well versed in SQL, the standard language for communicating with database systems.|University of California, Davis|Sadie St. Lawrence, Data Scientist at VSP Global ||Beginner|English|Pass all graded assignments to complete the course.|4.4
104|HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers|Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through the web page? Implement it poorly and, to the user, the server-side becomes irrelevant! Today’s user expects a lot out of the web page: it has to load fast, expose the desired service, and be comfortable to view on all devices: from a desktop computers to tablets and mobile phones.|Johns Hopkins University| Yaakov Chaikin, Adjunct Professor, Graduate Computer Science|Course 4 of 6 in the Ruby on Rails Web Development Specialization||English, Subtitles: Korean|Pass all graded assignments to complete the course|4.9
105|Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software|Learn to code in Java and improve your programming and problem-solving skills. You will learn to design algorithms as well as develop and debug programs. Using custom open-source classes, you will write programs that access and transform images, websites, and other types of data. At the end of the course you will build a program that determines the popularity of different baby names in the US over time by analyzing comma separated value (CSV) files.|Duke University|Owen Astrachan, Professor of the Practice|Course 1 of 4 in the Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization|Beginner|English, Subtitles: Turkish|Pass all graded assignments to complete the course.|4.6
